== What customers will appreciate ==

Being able to pay in installments an asset or service with interest 0 is the most important factor and pushes many customers to use the Smallpay service, preferring it to financial services that have very high costs. Furthermore, the activation of installments with a financial company is long and laborious and the practice can be refused. With Smallpay the outcome of the first transaction is given in real time and, if the first installment is successful, the subsequent installments will also be charged to the same card.

== What merchants will appreciate ==

Allowing payments in installments for an asset or service with interest 0 allows the operator to sell items of greater value or offer longer-term subscription services.

Not least, at the beginning of each month the operator receives in a single solution the total amount of the installments expiring in the reference month
